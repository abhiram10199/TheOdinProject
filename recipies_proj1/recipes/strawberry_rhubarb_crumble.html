        <!-- Description -->
        <p>
            This strawberry rhubarb crumble has a superb balance of sweet 
            and tart and a crumble that delivers both a hint of lemon zest 
            and the rich flavor of almonds. Served warm or at room temperature, 
            with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, it's the ultimate spring dessert.
        </p>

        <!-- Ingredients Listed -->
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup crushed almonds</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 cups fresh strawberries, quartered</li>
            <li>4 cups fresh rhubarb cut into small slices</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>(Optional) Whipped cream</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Steps to make it -->
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 190C / 375F</li>
            <li>For topping, stir together flour, almonds, 3/4 cup sugar, melted butter, lemon zest, 
                and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until clumps form. Cover and chill topping 
                while preparing filling.</li>
            <li>For filling, combine strawberries and rhubarb in a very large bowl. In a small bowl
                stir together remaining 1 cup sugar, cornstarch, and salt; add to fruit and toss well to combine.</li>
            <li>Transfer filling to a 3-quart rectangular baking dish. If using frozen fruit, let fruit mixture 
                stand for 45 minutes at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Cover filling with topping</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until fruit is bubbly in the center and topping is golden, about 1 hour 
                (1 1/2 hours if using frozen fruit). If topping is browning too quickly, cover with foil during the 
                last 30 minutes of baking time. </li>
            <li>Let stand for 30 minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature. 
                If desired, serve with whipped cream or ice cream.</li>
        </ol>
